Around winter of 2020 I played a West Marches style tapletop campaign. One of the 
features of this style is that the players are responsible for recording a map 
of a sandbox game as they discover the surrounding areas. Maps in these campaigns 
are often unreliable; they're only as good as the players' skill checks and methods 
for keeping the record. The first method was me roughly sketching in my dot grid 
journal, complete with arrows and doodles of goblins. 

Our game went completely remote shortly after it started. This made us completely 
unable to effectively share a physical map. So I built what I call the mapplication:

At the time of writing, this the map is representative of the discovered territories 
at the time our campaign ended. Feel free to poke around. Be sure to visit I6, where 
my Kenku fighter Yelp plummeted to his death after trying to make friends with a Roc.
